# Fannie_Mae_Default_Detection_Modelling
Project Overview
This repository hosts the FNMA Default Project Modelling phase, a continuation of the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This segment is dedicated to advancing our understanding and prediction of mortgage defaults through rigorous feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Key Aspects
Feature Engineering: Elaborates on the transformation and selection of features to enhance model accuracy.
Model Selection: Discusses the choice of models such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost, including the rationale behind these selections.
Model Evaluation: Details the approach for model performance assessment, focusing on metrics like Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC, and FICO Score.
Final Outcomes: Summarizes the results and insights derived from the models, highlighting their implications in predicting mortgage defaults.
Slide Presentation
Included is the FNMA Default Project Modelling.pdf slide presentation, providing a visual and textual narrative of the modelling process from start to finish.
Data Sources and References
