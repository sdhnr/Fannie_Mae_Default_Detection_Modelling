# FNMA Default Project Modelling

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the FNMA Default Project Modelling phase, a continuation of the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This segment is dedicated to advancing our understanding and prediction of mortgage defaults through rigorous feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Key Aspects
1. **Feature Engineering**: Elaborates on the transformation and selection of features to enhance model accuracy.
2. **Model Selection**: Discusses the choice of models such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost, including the rationale behind these selections.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Details the approach for model performance assessment, focusing on metrics like Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC, and FICO Score.
4. **Final Outcomes**: Summarizes the results and insights derived from the models, highlighting their implications in predicting mortgage defaults.

## Data Sources and References
1.**Fannie Mae**: Primary data source for mortgage loan details.
2.**Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Data**: Supplementary economic indicators.
3.**HUD User Data**: Geographical data for county zip codes, enriching the project's spatial analysis.
